Advanced Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest data generation machine for the time being. It doesnâ€™t produce the big data, the data is gigantic. Just one of the four experiments generates thousands gigabytes per second. The intensity of data flow is only going to be increased over the time. So the data processing techniques have to be quite sophisticated and unique.

In this online course students are introduced into the main concepts of the Physics behind those data flow so the main puzzles of the Universe Physicists are seeking answers for will be much more transparent. Of course the major stages of the data processing pipelines are scrutinized, and focus on the role of the Machine Learning techniques for such tasks as track pattern recognition, particle identification, online real-time processing (triggers) and search for very rare decays. The assignments of this course gives the opportunity to apply skills in the search for the New Physics using advanced data analysis techniques.
